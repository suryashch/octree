# Octree

How are Video Games able to render vast worlds, containing thousands of individual 3D objects with crystal clear graphics? How does the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm make lightning fast predictions based on training data? And how do mechanical engineers model the airflow over the wing of an F-35 fighter jet, with impeccable precision? The answer? An `Octree`.

An `Octree` is a data structure used universally by engineers, data scientists, and game developers to retrieve vast amounts of spatial data.


## What is an Octree

The `Octree` falls into the class of k-D Trees, and is a special case where the number of dimensions = 3. This means that every node in the tree has 8 children.
